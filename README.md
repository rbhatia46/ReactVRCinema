***
## How to run the app :
* Clone this repository
* Install the dependencies inside the project folder
```
npm install
```
* Run the dev server
```
npm start
```

You app will run on **localhost:8081/vr** by default.
***
**I strongly recommend running the app on Firefox(latest nightly build recommended) instead of Chrome for VR Support and best performance.**

* You can change the video, sound and the background image if you want and you can use a custom one. All you need to do is replace them in the **static_assets** folder with the new files having the same name.

* Use of a VR Headset can give you a very realistic feel(similar to an Outdoor Movie watch)

**Enjoy your Cinema!**
